## Description
``` 
I heard that packing things twice makes it really secure, even if we use the same password. This time it surely is uncrackable.
```
## Provided challenge files
* [chall.zip](../chall.zip)

# Writeup

## Enumeration

To begin, I used `file chall.zip` for an initial analysis of the provided challenge file. It revealed that it is a ZIP archive with the compression method set to 'store'. This indicates that the files within the ZIP archive are stored without compression.

Next, I executed `unzip -l chall.zip` to list the files inside the archive. As depicted in Figure 2, it contains a single file named `flag.zip`. Given the challenge's premise that double packing enhances security, it's logical to conclude that the flag is inside `flag.zip`. While one approach would be to extract and crack the hash, the challenge's hint about double zipping suggests a different method might the intended way.

In Figure 3, a hexdump of `chall.zip` shows the ZIP file beginning with the magic bytes `50 4b 03 04`. The file name of the contents is stored at offset 30, aligning with the standard ZIP file format as detailed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#File_headers).

## Exploit

In 2005, Eli Biham and Paul C. Kocher demonstrated in their paper[^paper] that the PKZIP stream cipher is susceptible to a known plaintext attack. The bkcrack tool[^bkcrack], which exploits this vulnerability, was the key to solving this challenge.

> `bkcrack` requires at least 12 bytes of known plaintext, with a minimum of 8 consecutive plaintext bytes.
{: .prompt-warning }

Assuming the nested structure `chall.zip > flag.zip > flag.txt`, we know the first 4 bytes of `flag.zip` are `50 4b 03 04`. We also expect the string `flag.txt` (`66 6c 61 67 2e 74 78 74`) at offset 30, providing us with 12 bytes of plaintext, 8 of which are consecutive. This sets the stage for using bkcrack.

First, I created a plaintext file with the ZIP file magic bytes, as shown in Figure 4.

Additional plaintext at a specific offset can be added using `-x <offset> <plaintext in hex>`.

_Figure 5 - Determining the hex representation of `flag.txt`_

I initiated bkcrack with the following command:

```bash
bkcrack -C chall.zip -c flag.zip -p plain.txt -x 30 666c61672e747874
```

Successful cracking of the internal encryption keys was confirmed, as shown in Figure 6.

Given that the same password was used for both ZIP files, the same internal keys could decrypt both. The decryption process is as follows:

```bash
# Decrypting chall.zip
bkcrack -C chall.zip -c flag.zip -k a9257a2e ce46cf59 f48452e6 -d flag.zip 
# Decrypting flag.zip
bkcrack -C flag.zip -c flag.txt -k a9257a2e ce46cf59 f48452e6 -d flag.txt
```

> **Tip:** The bkcrack tool does not need a file as an input for plaintext. It also works with:
```bash
bkcrack -C chall.zip -c flag.zip -x 0 504b0304 -x 30 666c61672e747874
```
