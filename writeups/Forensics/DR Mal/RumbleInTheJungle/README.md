## Writeup
The description hints for a malicious macro, which can be found in the MS document within the distributed ZIP-archive. Olevba is a tool from the Oletools suite to detect VBA Macros and extract their source code in clear text. The output from this tool on the challenge file is shown here.

![Alt text](olevba.png)

The output shows how the macro, triggered on document open, defines a subroutine called "MyMacro." This subroutine creates a Windows Installer object, sets its UI level, and attempts to install a file from ```https://drmal.io.ept.gg/flagInstaller.msi```.

Trying to fetch this files provides a response complaining ```Invalid User-Agent```. Google-ing the default UA used by Windows Installer eventually resulted in post where the UA ```Windows Installer``` was discussed. This worked! And the site now instead responded with the flag.

```sh
> curl "https://drmal.io.ept.gg/flagInstaller.msi" -H "User-Agent: Windows Installer"
