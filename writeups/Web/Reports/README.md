## Description
```
Once again, the development team of EPT has made a revolutionary website. 
This time, we needed to create some reports to keep track of things.

As always, we only use the latest and greatest programming languages. 
However, I'm not sure if everything has been done correctly. 
It seems that there are some broken parts in the code, but unfortunately, I'm unable to fix the errors :-(

On the other hand, I don't really care since everything works on my machine. 
There might be a prize for the special one who is able to navigate this piece of spaghetti code and find the path to nirvana.
